    <h4>Porthos</h4>
    <p>Porthos, my cat, is a purebred Persian. He is currently 10 years old. We got him about seven years ago, and although he is not as playful as he used to be, he still likes to have fun. His favorite thing to do is chase a laser pointer. Porthos also enjoys playing with the toys we occasionaly bring home for him. However, these toys do not last as long as they should. Our dog, Caramel, likes to chew up his toys.</p>

        My dog's name is Caramel. She is a boxer lab mix. Sure, it is a weird name for a dog, but it is fitting, as her fur is golden, resembling caramel.
